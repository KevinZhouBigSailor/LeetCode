 * Created by zzhou on 5/22/2017.
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

 Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 Example 1:
 3
 / \
 2   3
 \   \
 3   1
 Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
 Example 2:
 3
 / \
 4   5
 / \   \
 1   3   1
 Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
