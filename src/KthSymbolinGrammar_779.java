    /*
    Observation 1: N does not matter as long as “K will be an integer in the range [1, 2^(N-1)]”. We can ignore N.

    Observation 2: let f(k) be the value of kth position (0-based), then:
    f(2 * k) = 0 {if f(k) = 0} or, 1 {if f(k) = 1} => f(2 * k) = f(k) xor 0
    f(2 * k + 1) = 0 {if f(k) = 1} or 1 {if f(k) = 0} => f(2 * k + 1) = f(k) xor 1

    Obervation 3: if binary string of k is used, let k = 1001010, then we have:
    f(1001010) = f(100101) ^ 0 = f(10010) ^ 1 ^ 0 = f(1001) ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 0 = ... = f(0) ^ 1 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^1 ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 0 = 1 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^1 ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 0
    So, the result is the xor operation on all bits of k. Since 0 does not change xor result, we can ignore all 0s.
    f(1001010) = 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = (1^1) ^ 1 = 0 ^ 1 = 1
    f(11110011) = 1 ^ 1^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^1 = (1 ^ 1) ^ (1 ^ 1) ^ (1 ^1) = 0
    Now, it’s easy to tell f(k) = 0 if k has even number of 1s in binary representation, and f(k) = 1 when k has odd number of 1s
